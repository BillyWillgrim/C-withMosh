C# is a Programming Language

.Net is a framework for building applications on Windows

The .Net framework consists of two components:

  1. CLR (Common Language Runtime)
  2. Class Library

CLR: 

When you compile your C# code, the result is what we call IL (Intermediate Language) code, which is independent of the computer on which it is running.

Now we need to tranlate this IL code into the native language of the machine. This is the job of the CLR. This process is known as just-in-time compilation (JIT). 

With this architecture we can write an application in C# and not worry about compiling it into native code for different machines (windows/linux etc.).


Architecture of .NET Applications:

Namespaces are containers for related classes.

An assembly (DLL or EXE) is an assembly for related namespaces. Physically it is a file on a disk.

An application is made up of one or more assemblies.
